# Roadshows for OpenJS Projects Session

### From [GH issue #211](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/211)

## Question: Are other OpenJS projects interested in trying out the AMP roadshow model - or collaborating on global developer roadshow events?

## Some ideas that emerged:
* At AMP roadshows, could we let people know about other OpenJS projects and how to contribute to them? 
* Could other projects join AMP in a roadshow or run a session? Perhaps something about testing performance or node-based server-side build tools.
* Can such events help build OpenJS' community of communities?
* For sophisticated developers who are in attendance, can we reframe AMP roadshows as something for OpenJS projects?
* For people who want to contribute to a certain project, can we let them know there are more OpenJS projects to contribute to as well?
* What if attendees can add a tag on their badge saying they want to contribute? Can we have a sub-event for such people?
* What if we had a rep from OpenJS or the local projects at each AMP/OpenJS roadshow?
  * OpenJS may have a list of project maintainers in each city, which AMP could use to find such reps.
* What if AMP had an event or session in which attendees learned how to contribute?
* Could other OpenJS projects or the foundation help us source potential local contributors or other attendees?
* nodeschool has a nice model for creating meetups, in which people put up a github page saying they’ll get together and learn about something. There’s a slack channel for this too.
* OpenJS could create a Slack Channel to discuss creating a common meetup structure for projects.

Finally, individuals offered to help out with AMP roadshows in Colombia (especially Medellin) or Lahore.
